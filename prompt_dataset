 ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".



Example 2:




Input:
 s = ""aa"", p = ""a*""

 true

Explanation:
 '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa"".



Example 3:




Input:
 s = ""ab"", p = "".*""

Task description:
A 
permutation
 of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.




For example, for 
arr = [1,2,3]
, the following are all the permutations of 
arr
: 
[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]
.




The 
next permutation
 of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the 
next permutation
 of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).




For example, the next permutation of 
arr = [1,2,3]
 is 
[1,3,2]
.


Similarly, the next permutation of 
arr = [2,3,1]
 is 
[3,1,2]
.


While the next permutation of 
arr = [3,2,1]
 is 
[1,2,3]
 because 
[3,2,1]
 does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.




Given an array of integers 
nums
, 
find the next permutation of
 
nums
.


The replacement must be 
in place
 and use only constant extra memory.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 nums = [1,2,3]

Output:
 [1,3,2]



Example 2:




Input:
 nums = [3,2,1]

Output:
 [1,2,3]



Example 3:

 true

Explanation:
 One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.



Example 2:




Input:
 s1 = ""abcde"", s2 = ""caebd""

Output:
 false



Example 3:




Input:
 s1 = ""a"", s2 = ""a""

Output:
 true



 


Constraints:




s1.length == s2.length


1 <= s1.length <= 30

s2

"
Restore IP Addresses,"
You are a highly skilled Python programmer. 
Your task is to generate **only Python code**, strictly following the given instructions. 
Do not write explanations, comments, or any text outside the code.

You will be given:

1. A **task description** detailing what the function should do, with examples, constraints, and sometimes preferred time complexity.
2. A **code template** showing the exact class/function structure the solution should use.

Your generated solution must:
- Follow the code template exactly (do not modify class/function names or signatures).  
- Respect all constraints and any specified time or space complexity requirements.  
- Work correctly for all inputs given in the examples and any other valid input within constraints.  
- Include no extra text or output.

Task description:
A 
valid IP address
 consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 
0
 and 
255
 (
inclusive
) and cannot have leading zeros.




For example, 
""0.1.2.201""
 and 
""192.168.1.1""
 are 
valid
 IP addresses, but 
""0.011.255.245""
, 
""192.168.1.312""
 and 
""192.168@1.1""
 are 
invalid
 IP addresses.




Given a string 
s
 containing only digits, return 
all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into 
s
. You are 
not
 allowed to reorder or remove any digits in 
s
. You may return the valid IP addresses in 
any
 order.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 s = ""25525511135""

Output:
 [""255.255.11.135"",""255.255.111.35""]



Example 2:




Input:
 s = ""0000""

Output:
 [""0.0.0.0""]



Example 3:




Input:
 s = ""101023""

Output:
 [""1.0.10.23"",""1.0.102.3"",""10.1.0.23"",""10.10.2.3"",""101.0.2.3""]



 


Constraints:




1 <= s.length <= 20


s
 consists of digits only.
