Task description:
A 
permutation
 of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.




For example, for 
arr = [1,2,3]
, the following are all the permutations of 
arr
: 
[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]
.




The 
next permutation
 of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the 
next permutation
 of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).




For example, the next permutation of 
arr = [1,2,3]
 is 
[1,3,2]
.


Similarly, the next permutation of 
arr = [2,3,1]
 is 
[3,1,2]
.


While the next permutation of 
arr = [3,2,1]
 is 
[1,2,3]
 because 
[3,2,1]
 does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.




Given an array of integers 
nums
, 
find the next permutation of
 
nums
.


The replacement must be 
in place
 and use only constant extra memory.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 nums = [1,2,3]

Output:

Example 2:




Input:
 nums = [3,2,1]

Output:
 [1,2,3]



Example 3:

 One possible scenario applied on s1 is:
""great"" --> ""gr/eat"" // divide at random index.
""gr/eat"" --> ""gr/eat"" // random decision is not to swap the two substrings and keep them in order.
""gr/eat"" --> ""g/r / e/at"" // apply the same algorithm recursively on both substrings. divide at random index each of them.
""g/r / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/at"" // random decision was to swap the first substring and to keep the second substring in the same order.
""r/g / e/at"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // again apply the algorithm recursively, divide ""at"" to ""a/t"".
""r/g / e/ a/t"" --> ""r/g / e/ a/t"" // random decision is to keep both substrings in the same order.
The algorithm stops now, and the result string is ""rgeat"" which is s2.
As one possible scenario led s1 to be scrambled to s2, we return true.



Example 2:




Input:
 s1 = ""abcde"", s2 = ""caebd""

Output:
 false



Example 3:




Input:
 s1 = ""a"", s2 = ""a""

Output:
 true

Task description:
Given the 
head
 of a singly linked list, sort the list using 
insertion sort
, and return 
the sorted list's head
.


The steps of the 
insertion sort
 algorithm:




Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.


At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list and inserts it there.


It repeats until no input elements remain.




The following is a graphical example of the insertion sort algorithm. The partially sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. One element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list with each iteration.




 


Example 1:






Input:
 head = [4,2,1,3]

Output:
 [1,2,3,4]



Example 2:






Input:
 head = [-1,5,3,4,0]

- Follow the code template exactly (do not modify class/function names or signatures).  
- Respect all constraints and any specified time or space complexity requirements.  
- Work correctly for all inputs given in the examples and any other valid input within constraints.  
- Include no extra text or output.

Task description:
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (
push
, 
peek
, 
pop
, and 
empty
).


Implement the 
MyQueue
 class:




void push(int x)
 Pushes element x to the back of the queue.


int pop()
 Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.


int peek()
 Returns the element at the front of the queue.


boolean empty()
 Returns 
true
 if the queue is empty, 
false
 otherwise.




Notes:




You must use 
only
 standard operations of a stack, which means only 
push to top
, 
peek/pop from top
, 
size
, and 
is empty
 operations are valid.


Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.




 


Example 1:




Input

[""MyQueue"", ""push"", ""push"", ""peek"", ""pop"", ""empty""]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]

Output

[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]


Explanation

MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false



 


Constraints:




1 <= x <= 9


At most 
100
 calls will be made to 
push
, 
pop
,

All the calls to 
pop
 and 
peek
 are valid.




 


Follow-up:
 Can you implement the queue such that each operation is 
amortized
 
O(1)
 time complexity? In other words, performing 
n
 operations will take overall 
O(n)
 time even if one of those operations may take longer.

Delete Node in a Linked List,"
You are a highly skilled Python programmer. 
Your task is to generate **only Python code**, strictly following the given instructions. 
Do not write explanations, comments, or any text outside the code.

You will be given:

1. A **task description** detailing what the function should do, with examples, constraints, and sometimes preferred time complexity.
2. A **code template** showing the exact class/function structure the solution should use.

Your generated solution must:
- Follow the code template exactly (do not modify class/function names or signatures).  
- Respect all constraints and any specified time or space complexity requirements.  
- Work correctly for all inputs given in the examples and any other valid input within constraints.  
- Include no extra text or output.

Task description:
There is a singly-linked list 
head
 and we want to delete a node 
node
 in it.


You are given the node to be deleted 
node
. You will 
not be given access
 to the first node of 
head
.


All the values of the linked list are 
unique
, and it is guaranteed that the given node 
node
 is not the last node in the linked list.


Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:




The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.


The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.


All the values before 
node
 should be in the same order.


All the values after 
node
 should be in the same order.




Custom testing:




For the input, you should provide the entire linked list 
head
 and the node to be given 
node
. 
node
 should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.


We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.


The output will be the entire list after calling your function.




 


Example 1:






Input:
 head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5

Output:
 [4,1,9]

Explanation: 
You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.



Example 2:






Input:
 head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1

Output:
 [4,5,9]

Explanation: 
You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.



Example 2:




Input:
 n = 1

Output:
 0

Explanation:
 There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.



Example 3:




Input:
 n = 2

Output:
 1

Explanation:
 There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.
- Guess 1.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.
    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.
The worst case is that you pay $1.

Task description:
RandomizedCollection
 is a data structure that contains a collection of numbers, possibly duplicates (i.e., a multiset). It should support inserting and removing specific elements and also reporting a random element.


Implement the 
RandomizedCollection
 class:




RandomizedCollection()
 Initializes the empty 
RandomizedCollection
 object.


bool insert(int val)
 Inserts an item 
val
 into the multiset, even if the item is already present. Returns 
true
 if the item is not present, 
false
 otherwise.


bool remove(int val)
 Removes an item 
val
 from the multiset if present. Returns 
true
 if the item is present, 
false
 otherwise. Note that if 
val
 has multiple occurrences in the multiset, we only remove one of them.


int getRandom()
 Returns a random element from the current multiset of elements. The probability of each element being returned is 
linearly related
 to the number of the same values the multiset contains.




You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works on 
average
 
O(1)
 time complexity.


Note:
 The test cases are generated such that 
getRandom
 will only be called if there is 
at least one
 item in the 
RandomizedCollection
.

                                  // Inserts 2 into the collection. Collection now contains [1,1,2].
randomizedCollection.getRandom(); // getRandom should:
                                  // - return 1 with probability 2/3, or
                                  // - return 2 with probability 1/3.
randomizedCollection.remove(1);   // return true since the collection contains 1.
                                  // Removes 1 from the collection. Collection now contains [1,2].

UTF-8 Validation,"

- Respect all constraints and any specified time or space complexity requirements.  
- Work correctly for all inputs given in the examples and any other valid input within constraints.  
- Include no extra text or output.

Task description:
Given an integer array 
data
 representing the data, return whether it is a valid 
UTF-8
 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).


A character in 
UTF8
 can be from 
1 to 4 bytes
 long, subjected to the following rules:




For a 
1-byte
 character, the first bit is a 
0
, followed by its Unicode code.


For an 
n-bytes
 character, the first 
n
 bits are all one's, the 
n + 1
 bit is 
0
, followed by 
n - 1
 bytes with the most significant 
2
 bits being 
10
.




This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:



     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence
                       |              (binary)
   --------------------+-----------------------------------------
            1          |   0xxxxxxx
            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx



x
 denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 
0
 or 
1
.


Note: 
The input is an array of integers. Only the 
least significant 8 bits
 of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 data = [197,130,1]

Output:
 true

Explanation:
 data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.



Example 2:




Input:
 data = [235,140,4]

Output:
 false

Explanation:
 data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.

You will be given:

1. A **task description** detailing what the function should do, with examples, constraints, and sometimes preferred time complexity.
2. A **code template** showing the exact class/function structure the solution should use.

Your generated solution must:

- Respect all constraints and any specified time or space complexity requirements.  
- Work correctly for all inputs given in the examples and any other valid input within constraints.  
- Include no extra text or output.

Task description:
Given an array of characters 
chars
, compress it using the following algorithm:


Begin with an empty string 
s
. For each group of 
consecutive repeating characters
 in 
chars
:




If the group's length is 
1
, append the character to 
s
.


Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.




The compressed string 
s
 
should not be returned separately
, but instead, be stored 
in the input character array 
chars
. Note that group lengths that are 
10
 or longer will be split into multiple characters in 
chars
.


After you are done 
modifying the input array,
 return 
the new length of the array
.


You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.


Note: 
The characters in the array beyond the returned length do not matter and should be ignored.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 chars = [""a"",""a"",""b"",""b"",""c"",""c"",""c""]

Output:
 Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""2"",""b"",""2"",""c"",""3""]

Explanation:
 The groups are ""aa"", ""bb"", and ""ccc"". This compresses to ""a2b2c3"".



Example 2:




Input:
 chars = [""a""]

Output:
 Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: [""a""]

Explanation:
 The only group is ""a"", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.



Example 3:




Input:
 chars = [""a"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b"",""b""]

Output:
 Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: [""a"",""b"",""1"",""2""].

Explanation:
 The groups are ""a"" and ""bbbbbbbbbbbb"". This compresses to ""ab12"".


 


Constraints:




1 <= chars.length <= 2000


chars[i]

Task description:
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.


Each child 
i
 has a greed factor 
g[i]
, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie 
j
 has a size 
s[j]
. If 
s[j] >= g[i]
, we can assign the cookie 
j
 to the child 
i
, and the child 
i
 will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.


 


Example 1:




Input:
 g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]

Output:
 1

Explanation:
 You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.



Example 2:




Input:
 g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]

Output:
 2

Explanation:
 You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

Task description:
Design and implement a data structure for a 
Least Frequently Used (LFU)
 cache.


Implement the 
LFUCache
 class:




LFUCache(int capacity)
 Initializes the object with the 
capacity
 of the data structure.


int get(int key)
 Gets the value of the 
key
 if the 
key
 exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns 
-1
.


void put(int key, int value)
 Update the value of the 
key
 if present, or inserts the 
key
 if not already present. When the cache reaches its 
capacity
, it should invalidate and remove the 
least frequently used
 key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a 
tie
 (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the 
least recently used
 
key
 would be invalidated.




To determine the least frequently used key, a 
use counter
 is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest 
use counter
 is the least frequently used key.


When a key is first inserted into the cache, its 
use counter
 is set to 
1
 (due to the 
put
 operation). The 
use counter
 for a key in the cache is incremented either a 
get
 or 
put
 operation is called on it.


The functions 
get
 and 
put
 must each run in 
O(1)
 average time complexity.


 


Example 1:




Input

[""LFUCache"", ""put"", ""put"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""put"", ""get"", ""get"", ""get""]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [3], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]

Output

[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]


Explanation

// cnt(x) = the use counter for key x
// cache=[] will show the last used order for tiebreakers (leftmost element is  most recent)
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1
lfu.get(1);      // return 1
                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the LFU key because cnt(2)=1 is the smallest, invalidate 2.
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 1 and 3 have the same cnt, but 1 is LRU, invalidate 1.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2
lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3
lfu.get(4);      // return 4
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3

Task description:
We define 
str = [s, n]
 as the string 
str
 which consists of the string 
s
 concatenated 
n

For example, 
s1 = ""abc""
 can be obtained from 
s2 = ""ab
dbe
c""
 based on our definition by removing the bolded underlined characters.




You are given two strings 
s1
